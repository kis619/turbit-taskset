To do this project I had to come to terms with concepts I have been gravitating around
for quite some time without actually 'getting my hands dirty'.
This task was perfect for me because it was the exact amount of challenging - not so
easy that I would get bored and not so difficult that I would give up.

Here's some of the things I did:

Setting up a database service
(
    I got to explore three options:
    - installing it on my linux
    - using a docker container
    - using Atlas to host it for me
)

PLaying a bit with mongosh
(
    to get a feel about the structure.
)

Connecting it with my backend 
(
    easy enough but I had never done it
)

Connecting the backend with the frontend

Playing around with pandas
(
    - I may or may not have spent 10 minutes trying to figure out why I was getting errors
    reading the csv file, before realising the values were separated by a semicolon...............
    - Checking out the data
    - Formatting and reformatting the data for ease of use
)

Learning how to deploy!!
(
    From the moment I read the assignment I knew I wanted to actually deploy it.
    I had never done that before so it was very satisfactory when it finally worked

Dockering
(
    - Splitting the project into services and tying them all together with a docker compose
    - Port mapping turned out to be something which I needed extensive time to apply correctly
)
