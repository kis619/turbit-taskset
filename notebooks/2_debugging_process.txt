How would you find and fix an error that seems to occur randomly when an API endpoint is called?

I would argue that in 90% of the cases finding the error is almost equivalent to fixing it.
The other 10% you are wondering what poor life choices led you to this point,  where you have to
refactor 70% of your code.

To identify the cause of the error I try to demistify the randomness and find the actual cases
where it occurs. To do that I initially try to pinpoint the place or an area where the error
is coming from by some simple reasoning. I would ask myself questions and form hypotheses about the 
cause. Is the data in the db wrong, is the wrong data being retrieved, is the wrong data being
displayed? Often times this is enough to spot the error. When not, having narrowed down
the possibilities I would either start printing things or use an actual debugger. Another practical
approach I sometimes employ is commenting chunks of code out. I guess reading documentation also 
helps, but as one of my favourite programmer jokes goes: Debugging for 6 hours can save you 5 minutes
of reading documentation..

Lately I have also actively involved ChatGpt in my debugging process. Rubber ducking is still
an option and when everything else fails taking a walk really helps clear my mind.
