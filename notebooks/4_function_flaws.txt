What might be a problem with the provided function?

I could not spot a logical flaw, assuming start_consume_trigger_message handles
None gracefully.

However, the code could be tricky to maintain and is a bit difficult to read.
What could be done differently is splitting the code in two.
The 'if' tree could become a function get_trigger_callable and the body of
consume_trigger_messages becomes:

    consumer_group_name = trigger_consumer_rqmt.get_consumer_group_name()
    trigger_callable = get_trigger_callable(consumer_group_name, ...)

    trigger_consumer_rqmt.start_consume_trigger_message(
        trigger_callable=trigger_callable
    )

The silenced linter warning is also indicative that some design changes are
needed.
Putting the requirements in a class or some sort of data container might be
considered.

Also, instead of the else if tree a map could be used.

All these changes could be implemented to make the code
more easy to read and a bit easier to maintain.
