What are advantages and disadvantages of the port-adapter pattern?

Pros:
    - Since you uncouple the core logic from external sevices you are not
    depending on these services and can easily replace them ,if there is a need,
    without having to touch the main logic
    - Easier to test because of the lack of external dependencies. You can
    use a mock db for example

Cons:
    - More code ( and an extra layer of abstraction) hence more room for error
    - generally more complex and more challenging to run locally
    - multiple API calls could affect performance
